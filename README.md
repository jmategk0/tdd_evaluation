Section One: Implementation of Software Specifications

Instructions:

Our team uses agile software development techniques such as 
Test Driven Development (TDD) with Paired Programming using the 
Red-Green-Refactor methodology. This means Developer A will first write
a test that fails (The Red State); at the same time Developer B will 
write code to make that test pass by any means necessary. Once 
developer Bâ€™s code passes (The Green state) developer A and 
developer B will then review and refactor the code and test to optimize 
efficiency, readability, and maintainability.

 You have been given code for a small software library that is in the 
 Red State. Your task is to implement the code within the corresponding
 method signatures so that all the tests pass (The Green State). 
 Once all your tests pass one of our software developers will review 
 your code and you will discuss how it could be refactored it together.
 Please ask if you have any questions about the code you have been given. 
 


 Section Two: Software Design (optional)
 
 Instructions: 
 
 Real world problems are presented below. For each 
 problem you must design (bonus points if you implement as well) the 
 software requested by the users. The code you write should follow the 
 same style guidelines you saw in the previous section and should 
 include unit tests. Please ask if need any clarifications on the prompts. 
 
 1. Simulation Programming
 
 Isle Royale is a large island located in Lake Superior. 
 Scientists at Michigan Technological University have been studying the 
 predator prey relationships on the island for over 55 years because 
 only two major populations of carnivores and herbivories are present:
 Wolves and Moose. The Scientists have asked you to write a computer 
 simulation that utilizes past data and takes into account variable 
 conditions on Isle Royale to predict future treads in both populations.
 
| Year | Wolves | Moose |
|------|--------|-------|

| 2015 | 29     | 1116  |
| 2014 | 25     | 995   |
| 2013 | 17     | 1181  |
| 2012 | 28     | 850   |
| 2011 | 39     | 730   |
